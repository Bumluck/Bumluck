### Hey there! 👋

I'm [**Matthew**](https://sites.google.com/view/matthewyang), a gameplay programmer that is based in Orlando, Florida!

I am always looking to gain experience with programming cool features in games.

Right now I have the most experience with Unreal Engine, with Unity as a close second.

I have a few games that I have worked on but right now my favorite is [Purr Summer](https://ghost-knights.itch.io/purr-summer). ([Repo](https://github.com/popoyo07/SummerJam))

#### About Me:

- Favorite movie right now is No Other Choice
- I enjoy playing games of any genre. Some examples of them are:
    - White Knuckle
    - Satisfactory
    - Timberborn
- Can't drink any carbonated drinks. (My nose gets fizzy)
- I'm Korean, so I get to eat a lot of Korean food.
- **Hobbies**: Watching Movies/TV, Learning about random things in programming, Theme Parks
